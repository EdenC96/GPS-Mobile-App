App Worked in virtulisation (Android 5.1 - No Google API)

APK file doesn't run on 6.0+ as nothing is coded in to check for permissions 
(App crashes on launch after testing on 2 devices).

Only tested on 1 device running Android 5.1 (Nexus 7). 
App was able to run without crashing but wouldn't go to the second activity page upon clicking button. 
(Button text changed as coded in for error handling.)
